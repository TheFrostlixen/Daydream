Daydream

UNR CSE Senior Projects team 13: Matt Fredrickson, Sarah Koh, & JC Orolfo

The biggest barrier to fully immersive 3D virtual reality is the method of input; a controller or keyboard simply does not fit with this style of game, and ends up detracting from the immersive experience. Thus, we added a BCI (brain controlled interface) as a means of input, the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile. This device allows interaction with the in-game world using a completely new and innovative approach, by making the player control their mind to create an unparalleled sense of immersion in Daydream. This is accomplished by reading the user's focus and meditation/relaxation levels, and interacting with the game in different ways based on those inputs.

This project is not only a never-before-seen integration of smartphones, 3D environments, and brainwave readers, but also a look into alternate methods of input for virtual reality games so as not to impact the immersion aspect. Our primary focus was how to create a wide array of interactions with this minimalist interface. We hope you enjoy it and find it interesting.
